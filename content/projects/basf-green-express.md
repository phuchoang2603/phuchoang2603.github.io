This product emerged from my participation in the BASF Innovation Challenge, a national competition that empowers students to devise sustainability solutions, where we secured the 3rd Runner Up prize. While our aim was not the highest award, this competition established a robust foundation for me and our team to persist in researching and developing solutions to address the serious issue of e-waste
