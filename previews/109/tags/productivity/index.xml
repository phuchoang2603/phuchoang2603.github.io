We make these grand plans, give it our all for a few weeks or months, and then, bam! We&amp;rsquo;re back to the good old &amp;ldquo;throw it in the downloads folder with everything else&amp;rdquo; routine. It happens to the best of us, and I&amp;rsquo;m guilty too. But hey, even though I&amp;rsquo;ve still got loads of room for improvement, I can proudly say I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten way faster at finding my files.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Organizing My Digital Life - How My Workspace Evolved from Chaos to Hackintosh</title><link>https://phuchoang2603.github.io/previews/109/posts/productivity-workspace/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>xuanphuc.a1gv@gmail.com (Felix Hoang)</author><guid>https://phuchoang2603.github.io/previews/109/posts/productivity-workspace/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to introduce you to the journey of optimizing my workspace environment, or in simpler terms, my desk setup. In fact, I am not someone who strictly adheres to principles in life. However, I really enjoy working in a disciplined environment and always strive to optimize it for effective studying and working. To achieve the setup I have today, I had to tear down and rebuild this workstation more than 10 times. Finally, I am truly satisfied with it. It not only satisfies me aesthetically but also makes me eager to work as soon as I step into this room (well, not quite true because nowadays most of the time I feel most productive when working from a coffee shop&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
